# Stack Implementation

## Description

This project implements a Stack data structure in Python using a list as the underlying data structure. The Stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Features

- Initialization of an empty Stack or with a specified limit.
- Pushing elements onto the stack.
- Popping elements from the stack.
- Peeking at the top element of the stack without removing it.
- Checking if the stack is empty.
- Checking if the stack is full (if a limit is specified).
- Searching for an element in the stack and returning its distance from the top.

## Usage

To use the Stack class, follow these steps:

1. Import the Stack class from the `stack` module:

```python
from stack import Stack
